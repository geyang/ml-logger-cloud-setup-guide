# Quick Guided for Setting up ML-Logger Server

Contains two guides: 

- `aws` terraform recipie and setup guide: [aws-arch64-ebs](./aws-arch64-ebs/README.md)
- `gce` terraform recipie:  [gce-instrumentation](./gce-instrumentation/README.md)

The aws setup guide uses an `aarch64` (arm) instance type which is extrememly cost effective. The `gce` intance on the other hand is > $50 / month just for the compute itself.
